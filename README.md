# ASC-Emailer
Mass Email Drafter for ASC Communications

This code is designed for anyone -- with or without computer science experience -- to be able to mass draft emails as part of ASC communications. With the mass-email drafter, you will be able to mass-draft up to 500 template emails per day in your Gmail draft folder to mass-send out.

To run the mass email drafter, you first must first:
-- download Python on your computer
-- download visual studio code
-- download Python libraries
-- draft your desired email in HTML format 
-- have a cvs spreadsheet with company names, emails, and person names
-- get google authorization to use an API

Don't be intimidated by any of that jargon! I'll have a video explaining how to do everything that should take less than 30 minutes. 

Also: ChatGPT is your best friend if you have any questions. If there are any problems or bugs, copy-and-paste it into ChatGPT and ask it to fix it. It won't be perfect, but you'll be surprised what someone with no coding experience can do using ChatGPT. 


It's also fairly easy to set up an Email Sender in Python -- a program which can mass-draft emails and automatically send them out. However, Email Senders have many negatives:
-- They are not tracked by Hubspot
-- They are far more likely to be marked as spam
-- You're limited to sending out 100 emails per day
-- If there are mistakes, you'll be unable to change the emails after you run the program. 

For this reason, I highly recommend that people instead learn how to use the Email Drafter. Hope this is helpful!
