# ASC-Emailer
## Mass Email Drafter for ASC Communications

This code is designed for anyone -- with or without a computer science background -- to easily draft bulk emails as a part of ASC communications. The mass-email drafter enables you to draft up to 500 template emails daily in your Gmail draft folder, which you can then send easily. It is probably around 5x faster than copy and pasting different email templates and sending them out. 

### Getting Started
To run the mass email drafter, follow these steps:
1. Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your computer.
2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
3. Download necessary Python libraries.
4. Draft your desired email template in HTML format.
5. Prepare a CSV spreadsheet with company names, emails, and person names.
6. Obtain Google authorization to use an API.

> **Note**: Don't worry if these steps seem intimidating! I'll show you a tutorial video and everyone should be able to set-up everything in less than 30 minutes

### Email Sender in Python
Setting up an Email Sender in Python, which can mass-draft and automatically send out emails, is also doable. However, there are some disadvantages to consider:
- Emails are not tracked by Hubspot.
- Higher chances of emails being flagged as spam.
- Sending limit of 100 emails per day.
- In case of mistakes, you can't change the emails once the program has been executed.

Given these constraints, I'd strongly recommend you use this Email Drafter instead.

Hope you find this tool helpful!
